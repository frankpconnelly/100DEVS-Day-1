<h3>
    1.1 Introduction
</h3>

<p>
    I. Software Engineering as a career
    <ul>
        <li>High-paid</li>
        <li>Happiest</li>
        <li>Don't need a degree</li>
        <li>Very <strong>difficult!</strong></li>
    </ul>
    II. Leon Noel's background
    <ul>
        <li>Had a CS course in 6th grade, using CuBasic to make a sailboat to move across the screen.</li>
        <li>Went to an engineering high school in Philadelphia; had years of C++ experience from HS.</li>
        <li>Went to college at Yale to study biology, and completely forgot about code.</li>
        <li>Around sophomore year, got the entrepreneurship bug; wanted to build companies.</li>
        <li>Taught front end web development for 8+ years for General Assembly.</li>
        <li>Joined a non-profit called Resilient Coders; stipend for colored people in the Boston area.</li>
    </ul>
    III. What is Software Engineering?
    <ul>
        <li>Everyone has their own defintion, but it's a professional who writes code and understands not only how to write code, but also the tooling and instructions that a computer can understand.</li>
        <li>They might write web applications that run on a browser, apps on a phone, something that appears on your friedge, your coffee maker...</li>
        <li>You do not need a 4 year degree. Write code, conduct yourself as a professional, know and understand the systems behind the code you're writing... you are a software engineer.</li>
        <li>Software engineers have specialties. Our specialty will be a full stack web development specialty.</li>
        <li>You could take these skills and work on mobile apps. Robots, etc. The fundamentals will be the same, but the languages and tooling may be different in other specialties.</li>
    </ul>
    IV. Why Web Development?
    <ul>
        <li>One language. JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Full stack JavaScript is in high demand.</li>
        <li>Web Development is NOT taught in four year universities.</li>
        <li>This gives us an edge; if we can learn the practical skills needed, we can BACKFILL all the things we'd have learned in the four year program.</li>
        <li>As I progress, I can fill in my data structures, my algorithms, all the things that a four year CS degree would teach.</li>
    </ul>
    V. How do I do this for free?
    <ul>
        <li>Learn the basics</li>
        <li>Go through one full stack tutorial (this one)</li>
        <li>Build a passion project that you sink hours into</li>
        <li>Then, interview over and over and over!</li>
    </ul>
    VI. How can I be successful?
    <ol>
        <li>Manage your frustration</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You will fail. A lot. Get over it.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Consistency</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    One hour a day. That's it. Be realistic. Pick a time that's reasonable. Talk with family.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Take care of yourself</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint. Don't start hard and burn out; way too many people do that.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>
    1.2 Learning how to Learn
</h3>

<p>
    I. Active Recall
    <ul>
        <li>
            Repeat what you've learned out loud!
        </li>
    </ul>
    II. Spaced Repetition
    <ul>
        <li>
            Learn something. By day 3, there's a 40% chance we don't remember it; however, reviewing it each day mitigates the chances of forgetting it.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>
    1.3 What is the Internet?
</h3>

<p>
    I. The web is a wire. It connects a client-side device to a server. Both are computers.
    <ol>
        <li>
            Client-side device can be anything; a phone, a computer, a scanner...
        </li>
        <li>
            Server is another computer across the wire. It has a very appropriate name; it serves.
        </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Server serves up some information. That information finds its way to a client-side device. The info comes into the device, and we can consume or interact with that information.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>
    1.4 HTML5? What is it?
</h3>

<p>
    I. 5th iteration of HTML.
    <ol>
        <li>
            New features: video (no flash, no plugins; HTML5 just runs video natively.), audio (Soundcloud), canvas ("io" games), geolocation (allow/block location? Natively get location), websockets (Chat Roulette/Omegle)
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>
    The Golden Rule: Separation of Concerns
</h3>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Our HTML should ONLY be our content/structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our CSS should ONLY be our style.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our JS should ONLY be our behavior/interaction.
        </li>
    </ol>
    Simply put, if we work with a team (or come back to an old piece of code), know that if I wanted to add content, I'd go to HTML, style CSS, and interaction JS.
